  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Objective was to build a deep learning model to identify facial expressions using Transfer learning concept.</p></li>
    <li><p>Dataset was a combination of kaggle face challenge and images from the web.</p></li>
    <li><p>The VGG16 pre-trained network was fine tuned for the purpose and data augmentation was applied to compensate for low volume of the data set.</p></li>
    <li><p>A decent accuracy of 95 percent was achieved and a live recognition from video stream was implemented with the help of cv2 Haar-cascades.</p></li>
  </ul>
